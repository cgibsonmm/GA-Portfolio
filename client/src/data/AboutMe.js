const aboutMe = [
  "Hi, I am Corey Gibson, a full-stack software engineer living in Queens NYC. For most of my adult life, I have worked in Emergency Medical Services, working long hours and endless weeks providing care to sick or injured patients. For the past five years, I have served The City of New York as an Emergency Medical Technician for FDNY; even though I enjoyed this type of work at the end of the day, I would find myself complacent and wanting something more.",
  "Approximately four years ago, I had the chance to build a small website for a friend, and that's where my software engineering journey begings. In a few weeks, I found myself reading and learning all I could to attempt to build a small dating platform Sullivan Dates using Ruby on Rails, while this website never reached completion, it sparked a love for software development that I have yet to suffice.",
  "This July I decided that the time was right to leave FDNY and make my hobby/love my full-time career. I joined General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, taking the most significant risk of my life and loving every second of it. Now having a strong understanding of back-end and front-end technologies such as Ruby on Rails, React.js and D3.js I am eager and ready to take my next steps."
